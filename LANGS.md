# Interested In
```
Nim            Played around with it for a couple minutes. I'm a bit confused, feel I should learn Python first.
Julia          Not touched it, I saw it about 3-5 years ago. Happy to see it's prod ready now.
F#             Been watching this one for a while.
Squeak         Want to play around with this ...maybe just for fun?
Common Lisp    I like Racket and Clojure and I heard this is basically the C of Lisp.
D              C++ hurts, I've heard this was better, I just wanna try it out but I don't see anything that uses it...
Fortran        Interested to see why this is climbing the TIOBE index.
Haxe           Zanzlanz started using it, FNF uses it, I want to know the big deal.
Rust           This language intrigues me, though some fans of it seem like posers and are a bit obnoxious. 
Zig            I've heard this is 21st century C, and they better be correct.
AssemblyScript I've heard this is the C of WASM, whether or not that is true, that's up to me to figure out.
TypeScript     I've heard it's JavaScript with static types, which fixes my biggest complaint I have with JavaScript.
Python         Ranger is written in it and I like ranger, a lot of people I've met use this, I heard the standards are sane.
               Though from what I've heard it's meant for scripts and not giant projects. My only worry is the interpreter is
               REALLY SLOW but chances are I'm gonna like this. Hope to make some neat conversion utilities amongst other tools I wish I had.
Pony           I've toyed around with it before, I'm not gonna touch it for now until it's prod ready.
Ruby           I tried the 30 minute demo and I thought it was pretty cool, I heard it's nice for web stuff, I do web stuff, neat.
Pascal         Older people I've met talk about this, though I've heard lots of horror stories about it, recently, it's climbing TIOBE, I'm interested.
R              Saw it on TIOBE, interested to see what it is about.
Maximite BASIC Listen, BASIC is pretty good all things considered, I'm very interested in the Color Maximite computers.
ZX BASIC       Compiled Speccy BASIC sounds pretty cool.
Intybasic      Nanochess is one of the best programmers whose ever lived, this will probably be very good.
Kotlin         I've heard it's the future of the JVM, I want to try it out, just to know what it's like.
Objective-C    Only for iOS 6 stuff.
Perl           I've always been interested in Perl, I want to learn why it has so much hate.
BS             Joke programming language, might write tic-tac-toe or chess in it idk.
HSP            Hot Soup Processor is such a funny name, a couple games I've played were made in it too.
```

### Languages I'm not interested in.
```
Visual Basic   This thing looks horrendous, I hope to never touch it.
Classic VB     See above[0]
VBA            See above[0]
PHP+SQL        I've worked with it before, I just don't like it, I'm fine if you like it but for me it conflicts with my entire process of programming.
COBOL          It just doesn't have a place in my workflow.
TI BASIC       I've heard that this thing is a bitch to work with.
APL            I like reading.
TECO           I have fucking dyslexia.
