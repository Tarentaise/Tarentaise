- 👋 Hello, my name is Tarentaise.
- 💻 I’m interested in low level and high level programming, I like to rethink the way we do things currently.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning modern graphics programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, operating systems, homebrew and hax.
- 🎨 I think programming is a form of art, your code should be as clean and simple as possible and easy to maintain, like a well painted piece.
- 📰 I am currently working on some porting projects and decompilation projects.
- ☎ You can contact me many different ways, though I won't list them here, you should know me.

"Data will always be data, sorry if your project got reverse engineered, that's how computers work."
